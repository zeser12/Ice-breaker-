Chris has a dog named Mei and she loves Bratwurst! One day, Mei tried to steal some Apfelkuchen off the table but it was too high. After failing to obtain the tasty treat, Mei decided to put on her nicest dirndel and head down to the nearest baeckerei. On the way to the baeckerei, Mae engaged in a wettbewerbsfaehig rabbit chase with a hund and a BMW Isetta, which ended with her snout covered in suspicious looking powder after impacting what turned out to be a Mehlhase. After returning to her journey to the baeckerei, Mei happened upon an Eltz. There was a BMW parkedout front so she decided to go for a joyride down the hauptstrasse. Once Mei realized the BMW did not have klimaanlage, she abandoned the car and exchanged it for a nearby Porsche. Mei drove it halfway to her favorite Biergarten in Berlin before she realized the Porsche was made of Brot. Confused, Mei stopped at a nearby Ratskeller for a Doener before continuing her strange adventure. They went to Eltz and Schloss themselves to eat Apfelkuchen.
